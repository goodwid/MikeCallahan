[12:31] <AuntieEn> Seriously, can't even ftp OUT from your box?
[12:33] <AuntieEn> All I get is permission errors with scp
[12:35] <Flaim> which box?
[12:36] <AuntieEn> flaim.net
[12:36] <Flaim> maureen is public-key only auth
[12:36] <AuntieEn> probably woodrow
[12:36] <Flaim> or private-key auth, whichever
[12:36] <AuntieEn> wait, minerva syas the pronpt
[12:36] <Flaim> flaim.net is minerva, which accepts password-auth'd ssh
[12:36] <Flaim> no ftp installed tho?
[12:36] <AuntieEn> Or jsut put Mike's current .tar file in mike@sip.lmudc.net/~/junk
[12:37] <AuntieEn> I tried to ftp out, lol. no such program
[12:37] <Flaim> ok, ftp is installed
[12:37] <AuntieEn> I'm ssh to both sip and minerva
[12:37] <AuntieEn> And tried scp both ways, without any of you even sufggesting it lol
[12:37] <AuntieEn> but that failed
[12:37] <AuntieEn> :)
[12:37] <Flaim> hehehe
[12:37] <AuntieEn> callahan@minerva [Sun 10Mar2013] 12:36 ~ 256> ftp open sip.lmudc.net
[12:37] <AuntieEn> ftp: Command not found.
[12:38] <AuntieEn> I even did man scp and looked it up, tried form both boxes
[12:38] <AuntieEn> I'm settingMike up for somethign else, so user name on sip is mike, same pass
[12:39] <Flaim> run 'rehash'
[12:40] <Flaim> tcsh caches what's in the path.. if it changes, it needs to re-hash the path
[12:40] <AuntieEn> well fuck, now I've got to open it on sip, rofl
[12:40] <Flaim> also, what error were you getting w/ scp?
[12:42] <AuntieEn> callahan@minerva [Sun 10Mar2013] 12:29 ~ 251> scp ~/Mike.tar.gz mike@sip.lmudc.net:~/Mike.tar.gz
[12:42] <AuntieEn> mike@sip.lmudc.net's password: 
[12:42] <AuntieEn> /home/callahan/Mike.tar.gz: Permission denied
[12:43] <Flaim> huh.
[12:43] <AuntieEn> SO I really did go out of my way to do this without asking for help, lol
[12:43] <Flaim> ahh.  permissions error.
[12:43] <Flaim> solved.
[12:44] <AuntieEn> Yes
[12:44] <AuntieEn> callahan@minerva [Sun 10Mar2013] 12:29 ~ 251> scp ~/Mike.tar.gz mike@sip.lmudc.net:~/Mike.tar.gz
[12:44] <AuntieEn> mike@sip.lmudc.net's password: 
[12:44] <AuntieEn> /home/callahan/Mike.tar.gz: Permission denied
[12:44] <AuntieEn> gah
[12:44] <AuntieEn> anyways, should ahve it now
[12:45] <AuntieEn> quick question, to which directory should O move that too to untar?  ~/eggdrop1.x.x ?
[12:47] <Flaim> none.  it'll create 'eggdrop' when you untar it
[12:47] <Flaim> i generally make tars that pop into a dir
[12:47] <AuntieEn> I already have eggdrop, adn it's installed to eggdrop<ver>/
[12:49] <AuntieEn> oh, that's the whole file
[12:49] <AuntieEn> I jsut need the data/scripts/.conf
[12:49] <AuntieEn> This is CentOS, can't jsut plop that in
[12:53] <Flaim> can't just plop what in?
[12:59] <AuntieEn> It looks like it's not Mike that's tarred, but eggdrop
[12:59] <AuntieEn> it's got all the help, and .so modules
[12:59] <AuntieEn> and source
[13:00] <AuntieEn> eggdrop/eggdrop1.6.17rc1/src/mod/share.mod/help/set/

[13:00] <AuntieEn> eggdrop/eggdrop1.6.17rc1/src/mod/irc.mod/
[13:01] <AuntieEn> hate moving files in CLIs.  Cna't use flat models
[13:01] <AuntieEn> no visible hierarchy
[13:09] <Flaim> well yeah, that tarball has everything
[13:09] <Flaim> i guess you can open the tar in 7zip in windows and delete all that crap
[13:11] <Flaim> in a perfect world, we'd make a git repo for mike, and we could just install eggdrop, and check outa copy on a new box and whoosh
[13:15] <AuntieEn> sure
[13:17] <Flaim> dunno how to do that yet.
[13:18] <AuntieEn> OK, jsut mail that file to me, I'll figure it out
[13:18] <Flaim> mail what file?
[13:18] <AuntieEn> mike's tar
[13:18] <AuntieEn> no way to get tehre form here right now
[13:18] <Flaim> it's on sip, no?
[13:18] <AuntieEn> not to windows
[13:18] <Flaim> you can't..  ok
[13:18] <AuntieEn> yeah, but I have the same problem getting it for sip that I do from minerva, rofl
[13:19] <AuntieEn> ftp isn't installed on sip, or it's locke down tight
[13:19] <Flaim> what's your server name?
[13:19] <AuntieEn> sip
[13:19] <Flaim> the windows server
[13:19] <AuntieEn> .lmudc.net
[13:19] <AuntieEn> vpn.lmudc.net
[13:19] <Flaim> what's its local ip?
[13:19] <AuntieEn> 67.42.2.116
[13:19] <Flaim> is there a shared folder on there?
[13:19] <AuntieEn> sip is 117 blueberry (this box) is 115
[13:19] <AuntieEn> no
[13:20] <AuntieEn> wait, vpn?  there's a whole shared domain
[13:20] <AuntieEn> \\lmudc\
[13:20] <Flaim> gimme a shared folder name on .. ok
[13:20] <Flaim> and a share name?
[13:20] <AuntieEn> \\lmudc\admin data \\lmudc\user data
[13:20] <Flaim> smoe public share on lmudc
[13:20] <AuntieEn> Ther is no public share
[13:20] <AuntieEn> hell no
[13:21] <AuntieEn> it's all locked up via LDAP
[13:21] <AuntieEn> You've got to ahve a user:pass
[13:23] <Flaim> ok, make a user/pass for sip to connect to a share so i can mount it
[13:24] <AuntieEn> one moment
[13:24] <Flaim> ok
[13:24] <tamouse__> it's been quite a while since i looked at eggdrop
[13:25] <tamouse__> is it possible to keep the actual eggdrop installation "clean" (so to speak) and put custom code in another dirtree?
[13:25] <AuntieEn> could be
[13:25] <AuntieEn> but oyu'd have to tweak some thigns to point
[13:25] <AuntieEn> I know I've done it once
[13:25] <AuntieEn> it creates all kinds of cinfusion :)
[13:25] <tamouse__> if so, upgrading eggdrop could be separate from custom code, and should be fairly transparent
[13:26] <AuntieEn> you can upgrade eggdrop easily.
[13:26] <AuntieEn> and leave data in place
[13:26] <Flaim> what's the ip for lmudc?
[13:26] <tamouse__> ok
[13:26] <AuntieEn> he tarred up data + code compiled on his box.  I seriously dount that'll run on my CentOS box
[13:26] <AuntieEn> 67.42.2.112
[13:26] <AuntieEn> But I think you asked the wrogn question
[13:27] <AuntieEn> because that's the network IP address for lmudc.net
[13:27] <AuntieEn> 2003 = vpn.lmudc.net == 67.42.2.116'
[13:27] <AuntieEn> Asterisk == sip.lmudc.net == 67.42.2.117 (CentOS)
[13:28] <AuntieEn> 118 is gateway.lmudc.net
[13:28] <AuntieEn> 115 is blueberry, 114 is emerald (Zac's) and 113 is unassigned (I took the tomato router out, was able to config the modem properly)
[13:29] <Flaim> ok, i emailed the file
[13:29] <Flaim> we'll fix your network filesharing problems at a later time :)
[13:30] <Flaim> i installed samba and samba-client on sip
[13:31] <AuntieEn> np
[13:31] <AuntieEn> I trust you
[13:31] <AuntieEn> I've lawasys kept win/nix seperate
[13:31] <AuntieEn> Remember, when I first started learnign, LDAP was read-only for a long time
[13:31] <AuntieEn> Could read NTFS< but not write to it.
[13:32] <Flaim> on my file server at owrk, I do AD-auth for login
[13:32] <Flaim> it's been a while since i set it up but I could do it again i'm sure
[13:33] <AuntieEn> I jsut want them to work likethey're not on different OSes
[13:33] <AuntieEn> network shouldn't know fuck-all about waht OS stores the data
[13:34] <AuntieEn> different layer
[13:34] <tamouse__> network don't care
[13:34] <tamouse__> network don't give a damn
[13:36] <AuntieEn> Jsut saying I shouldn't need to know if it's nix or win to mount a network drive
[13:36] <AuntieEn> Nro shoudl my computer have to know.
[13:36] <AuntieEn> ISn't this why we have fucking APIs?
[13:37] <tamouse__> mounting a drive is something well below the api level
[13:37] <tamouse__> it's in the kernel
[13:37] <AuntieEn> I'm saying htat's hwo it shoudl work
[13:37] <tamouse__> yup, that is how it should work
[13:37] <AuntieEn> I don't suppose nix can handle .rar files?
[13:37] <tamouse__> there are tools which will, sure
[13:38] <tamouse__> tar doesn't
[13:38] <AuntieEn> I did  atore, not a compress
[13:38] <AuntieEn> I walwsys thaouhgt rar was windows tar
[13:38] <tamouse__> 7z handles them
[13:38] <Flaim> there are linux tools for rar
[13:38] <tamouse__> noooo....
[13:39] <AuntieEn> 7z always fucking acts weird
[13:40] <Flaim> winrar handles tarballs too, so it goes both ways
[13:40] <tamouse__> there's also rar/unrar on 'nix
[13:40] <tamouse__> tar only handles tar files
[13:40] <tamouse__> no other kinds of collections
[13:41] <AuntieEn> Yes, but winrar won't make a .tar
[13:41] <AuntieEn> so you're getting a stored .rar
[13:41] <AuntieEn> no compression
[13:42] <AuntieEn> wtf wont' google let you send a god damned .rar?
[13:42] <tamouse__> can you use dropbox instead?
[13:43] <AuntieEn> No, I'm jsut going tocreate an extension for google: .jlmfsi
[13:43] <AuntieEn> Just Let Me Fuckign Send It
[13:43] <tamouse__> got that in one :)

[13:55] <Flaim> ok, on sip, cd to /mnt/lmudc
[13:55] <Flaim> :)
[13:57] <Flaim> howto: mount -t cifs //lmudc/User\ data -ouser=<username> 
[13:57] <Flaim> then type in password.

[14:43] <Flaim> oh.  ok, standby
[14:44] <Flaim> huh.  centos has no eggdrop package
[14:49] <AuntieEn> I jsut did configure, make, make isntall make clean
[14:49] <AuntieEn> yeah, tried yum for that, rof
[14:50] <AuntieEn> taht is how I got gcc and tcl though
[14:50] <AuntieEn> took a stab at "yum install gcc" and "yum install tcl-something"
[14:53] <AuntieEn> But how do I do that for the system, rather than a user?
[14:55] <Flaim> hang on
[14:57] <AuntieEn> Somethign tells me doing it as root may sound like a good idea at the time, soething also tells me that could be a huge mistake, jsut not as big as chmod -r pixel
[14:57] <AuntieEn> chown, rather
[15:00] <Flaim> rofl
[15:01] <Flaim> running
[15:03] <Flaim> ok, it's joined #pro-unit
[15:04] <Flaim> i'm assuming you can take it from here?
[15:04] <AuntieEn> yup
[15:04] <AuntieEn> did you run it -m?
[15:05] <Flaim> no?
[15:05] <AuntieEn> MUST do that first time
[15:05] <Flaim> it wasn't the first time
[15:06] <Flaim> since it was from the tarball
[15:06] <AuntieEn> It better be
[15:06] <AuntieEn> AuntieEmd oesn't exist as owner
[15:06] <AuntieEn> not my nick over there, using in-game nick
[15:06] <Flaim> hmmm
[15:06] <Flaim> ok
[15:06] <Flaim> well i gotta go clean house.. 
[15:06] <AuntieEn> crap, lemme fix this
[15:07] <Flaim> worst case, you can nuke the users file and re-build it
[15:07] <Flaim> but it runs :)
[15:07] <AuntieEn> yeah, have to
[15:09] <Flaim> kk
[15:10] <Flaim> afk
[15:11] <AuntieEn> Ok, jsut did a rm ~/eggdrop/Callahan.*
[15:11] <AuntieEn> ran it as -m, all is well :0
[15:33] <Flaim> kewl
[15:33] <AuntieEn> Sad day
[15:33] <Flaim> ?
[15:33] <AuntieEn> Someone on quakenet was already using the nick Callahan
[15:33] <AuntieEn> talked for a bit
[15:34] <AuntieEn> But apparently, eh's the type to actually disconnect when he's done
[15:34] <AuntieEn> So he's already lost the nick, rofl
[15:34] <Flaim> bummer.
[15:34] <AuntieEn> I'm sure I'll be hearing about that soon enough "Say, you rbot took my nick"
[15:35] <Flaim> heh, likely, unless you change the bot's nick
[15:36] <AuntieEn> Yeah, fat fucking chance
[15:36] <AuntieEn> I'd sooner marry Ismoon
[15:48] <AuntieEn> Issues:
[15:48] <AuntieEn> [2013-03-10 15:44:02] NOTICE[3243]: chan_sip.c:13239 sip_reg_timeout:    -- Registration for 'afeather-user@67.40.255.172' timed out, trying again (Attempt #4937) 
[15:48] <AuntieEn> lol
[15:50] <AuntieEn> I jsut disabled his trunk, will enable once it's running again :)
[15:53] <Flaim> heh
[16:15] <AuntieEn> Now.
[16:15] <AuntieEn> Can we clone that install?
[16:15] <AuntieEn> I mean, if I made user callahan
[16:15] <AuntieEn> cp'd it all
[16:15] <AuntieEn> I coudl run undernet's aain, right?
[16:17] <AuntieEn> Could, not necessarily *will*, lol.
[16:17] <AuntieEn> I'd be an absebtee landlord, much like Conf was for 5 years.  I wasn't too thrille about how that worked, so it's jsut better is someone tehre runs him
[16:27] #mary'splace: mode change '-b *!*@c-71-236-84-58.hsd1.pa.comcast.net' by Rudin!~Rudin@69.20.192.85
[17:07] <tamouse__> it should be very simple to clone mike and keep separate config and data files. This is one very nice feature git repos provide -- you don't include the files that will be custom per network in the repo, and you can simply pull whatever other changes in each install really easily
[17:07] <AuntieEn> yeah, taht'd be nice to setup for Mike and Pix
[17:07] <AuntieEn> Maybe after a semester or two, adn I've actually learned about it :)
[17:07] <tamouse__> nodnod
[17:13] <tamouse__> i'm hard-over on using version control systems. i keep everything i do in them, even one-shot personal things
[17:14] <tamouse__> i have a private repo for letters
[17:15] <tamouse__> probably no one needs to go to the extreme i do
[17:15] <AuntieEn> rofl
[17:15] <tamouse__> it's just a furiously hard habit
[17:15] <tamouse__> not one i'm inclined to change
[17:15] <AuntieEn> yeah, I have plety of those
[17:15] <AuntieEn> it's hard-coding patches to ADHD, lol
[17:15] kat`` (kat@108.88.155.23) joined #Mary'sPlace.
[17:16] <AuntieEn> heya kat :)
[17:16] <tamouse__> nod
[17:16] <kat``> heya bren
[17:16] <kat``> hey tam
[17:16] <tamouse__> i don't have ADHD, but i have enough other stuff 
[17:16] <tamouse__> hi kat
[17:16] <AuntieEn> Exactly.
[17:16] <kat``> i also found manual online as a pdf :)
[17:16] <tamouse__> awesome. i figured they'd be available
[17:16] <kat``> yupyup
[17:16] <tamouse__> i still haven't found my nikon cable, but at least i know i didn't mail it
[17:17] <kat``> i am still just playing with it trying to get the right lighting at home to get good pics of gingersnap
[17:17] <kat``> yupyup
[17:17] <tamouse__> i really only need it when i'm traveling with the camera, though
[17:18] <kat``> i hope you find it
[17:18] <tamouse__> i will, eventually :>
[17:18] <tamouse__> i don't currently have a traveling pc though, either
[17:18] <kat``> am also going to get a better case the one i am using now just fits the camera
[17:18] Action: kat`` nods
[17:18] <kat``> i don't either my old ibm thinkpad is pretty much dead
[17:18] <tamouse__> i can't make any recs on cases; i never use them
[17:19] <kat``> really?
[17:19] <tamouse__> newp
[17:19] <kat``> how come?
[17:19] <tamouse__> i find them more of a pain than anything
[17:19] <tamouse__> i have a big bag for the nikon, which makes it easy to stow in a trunk
[17:20] <tamouse__> but when i'm out using it, i just carry it
[17:20] <kat``> true they can be but i do plan on having the camera on me most of the time, so a small case would be good to keep my purse/backpack from eating it
[17:20] <tamouse__> i used to just toss it in my purse
[17:20] <kat``> aye, you were worried bout the back getting sctratched?
[17:21] <tamouse__> not particularly
[17:21] <kat``> ok
[17:21] <tamouse__> idk
[17:21] <kat``> i am hoping to go to oregon in may
[17:21] <tamouse__> i've never been worried about that sort of thing, really
[17:21] <kat``> i tend to be a worrywort
[17:21] <tamouse__> the one concession to that i do make is a ND filter on my regular camera lenses
[17:22] Action: kat`` nodnods
[17:22] <kat``> my dad always used at least a uv one on his
[17:22] <tamouse__> oh, yeah, i meant UV
[17:23] <tamouse__> and i do use lens caps, fore and aft
[17:24] <kat``> ya to protect the lens
[17:24] <kat``> i think my dad is letting my niece use his stuff, she's got a good eye for it
[17:24] <tamouse__> cool
[17:25] <kat``> ya she's a good kid, inpite of her mother's screwups
[17:27] <kat``> i almost got a good closeup on kitty until she decided to put nose on lens
[17:51] <Flaim> re
[17:52] <kat``> hey flaim
[17:57] <tamouse__> hi flaim
[17:58] <Flaim> tam: where does git put things?
[17:59] <tamouse__> git is a distributed system
[17:59] <tamouse__> you have your own local repo
[17:59] <Flaim> ok.. 
[18:00] <tamouse__> others can clone your repo and you can update each other
[18:00] <tamouse__> there is often a remote depot, which is what github, gitorious, bitbucket and others provide
[18:00] <Flaim> ok
[18:00] <tamouse__> or you can have your own remote private ones as well
[18:00] <Flaim> yeah
[18:01] <Flaim> i'd prolly rather do that
[18:01] <tamouse__> no repository is more "real" than any other, except by agreed upon convention
[18:01] <Flaim> right
[18:01] <tamouse__> so i have a whole bunch of private repos on my vps
[18:01] <tamouse__> and access them via ssh
[18:02] <tamouse__> like so: git@tamaratemple.com:repos/<reponame>
[18:02] <Flaim> ahhh
[18:02] <Flaim> so is that a user named git?
[18:02] <tamouse__> and since it's ssh, it's smart enough to use stored public keys
[18:02] <tamouse__> yes
[18:03] <Flaim> right
[18:03] <tamouse__> merely a convention
[18:03] <tamouse__> can be anything
[18:03] <Flaim> sure
[18:03] <tamouse__> i like git a lot, but there are others: mercurial (hg), bazaar, etc
[18:03] <Flaim> sure
[18:04] <Flaim> git seems cool
[18:04] <tamouse__> i find them *way* lots easier than cvs or subversion
[18:04] <Flaim> i like the lack of centralized server
[18:04] <Flaim> yeah i never could grok subversion
[18:04] <Flaim> so if i was gonna make a repo of mike, how would i go about that?
[18:05] <tamouse__> first thing, go into mike's code directory, type 'git init .
[18:05] <tamouse__> '
[18:05] <tamouse__> oh, well, maybe install git first ...
[18:06] <Flaim> hehe did that
[18:06] <tamouse__> second thing, create a .gitignore file in that directory, and put in any files you DON'T want in the repo
[18:07] <tamouse__> it can be whole directories, like: 'temp/' for example
[18:07] <tamouse__> would keep all files that might end up in temp/ from being added to the repo
[18:07] <Flaim> oh cool
[18:07] <Flaim> yeah
[18:07] <tamouse__> a well-tuned .gitignore file is crucial
[18:08] <Flaim> sure
[18:08] <tamouse__> because then all you do is 'git add --all -v' to tell git which files to track
[18:08] <tamouse__> and 'git status' iz ur frenz
[18:08] <tamouse__> it will tell you what files are tracked, untracked, staged for commit, etc
[18:09] <tamouse__> including what branch you might be on
[18:09] <Flaim> should I assume that git ignores . files?
[18:09] <tamouse__> the trunk is called 'master' by convention
[18:09] <Flaim> kk
[18:09] <tamouse__> nope
[18:09] <tamouse__> nope nope nope
[18:09] <Flaim> oh. ok.
[18:09] <tamouse__> because that .gitignore file should definitely be included in your repo
[18:10] <tamouse__> i have stock .gitignore that contains '.DS_Store' (fucking mac-ism), '.localized' (another FM), '*~' (emacs/vim backup files) and so on
[18:11] <tamouse__> i typically also ignore archives (tar, tgz, zip, bz2, etc)
[18:11] <Flaim> right.
[18:11] <tamouse__> .gitignore does shell wild cards
[18:11] Action: kat`` is confuzzled
[18:11] <tamouse__> let me shoot you my standard .gitignore
[18:13] <tamouse__> it has more in it than you'll typically need, but it's a good example, i think
[18:13] <tamouse__> should be incoming in e-mail
[18:13] <tamouse__> whatup, kat?
[18:13] <Flaim> cool, that'll be a good start
[18:13] <kat``> is git a mac thing?
[18:13] <tamouse__> nope
[18:13] <tamouse__> it's way cross platform
[18:14] <tamouse__> linux, bsd, mac, winderz, ios, android
[18:14] <tamouse__> chrom
[18:14] <tamouse__> git is how the linux kernel is managed
[18:15] <tamouse__> flaim, after you've run git add --all -v, then you need to make the commit: git commit -m <commit msg>
[18:15] <tamouse__> that's all you need for keeping a local repo
[18:16] <tamouse__> snapping a branch for starting a new chunk of development is easie-peasie
[18:16] <tamouse__> git checkout -b <newbranchname>
[18:17] <tamouse__> and when you're done and tested and everything is great: git checkout master ; git merge <newbranchname>
[18:17] <Flaim> kk
[18:17] <kat``> hmms
[18:17] <tamouse__> if there are any conflicts, it will tell you, and mark them in the appropriate files
[18:17] <Flaim> nice
[18:18] <tamouse__> here's how my workflow goes:
[18:18] <tamouse__> 1. snap a new branch to start some work
[18:18] <tamouse__> 2. work in the branch, coding, testing, debuging, until i 'm happy with it
[18:18] <tamouse__> 3. merge branch into develop
[18:19] <tamouse__> 4. push up to remote depot
[18:19] <tamouse__> 5. pull into staging area (assuming this is a web site)
[18:19] <tamouse__> 6. test in staging
[18:20] <tamouse__> 7. if problems, go back the development branch and fix things, test, and promote through master to remote
[18:20] Action: kat`` nods
[18:20] <tamouse__> 8. when all is shiny, pull into production
[18:20] <tamouse__> 9. delete working branch
[18:20] <kat``> so it's not a backup system?
[18:20] <tamouse__> that's what i do for my personal stuff
[18:21] <tamouse__> not really
[18:21] <tamouse__> but it actually is a way to keep things backed up in a way that works for development
[18:21] <kat``> aye
[18:21] <tamouse__> i was saying previously, i use it for everything i create
[18:21] <tamouse__> but i don't use it to back up everything on my system
[18:22] <tamouse__> and i don't use it to backup media
[18:22] <tamouse__> if i'm making graphics for something in a web site, i will include those in the repo
[18:22] <tamouse__> but not photographs, music, or video
[18:23] <tamouse__> that would be way too heavy on the I/O
[18:23] <tamouse__> and there are much better means for those huge files
[18:23] Action: kat`` nodnods
[18:24] <kat``> do you know is windows media audio files can be converted to mp3?
[18:24] <tamouse__> i also use it, forex, to keep my /etc/ under control
[18:24] <tamouse__> and even my home dir dotfiles
[18:24] <tamouse__> oh sure
[18:24] <tamouse__> unless there's drm involved, then i'm not sure
[18:24] Action: kat`` nods
[18:24] <tamouse__> ffmpeg though will convert just about anything
[18:25] <kat``> i'll have to get it
[18:25] <tamouse__> the swiss army knife of multimedia
[18:25] <kat``> i have a bunch on my external hd
[18:25] <tamouse__> yeah
[18:25] <tamouse__> it's installable via apt
[18:25] <kat``> i also get the lovely task of dupe checking
[18:25] <tamouse__> look for something called fslint
[18:26] <tamouse__> it ferrets out dupe files
[18:26] <kat``> oooh i will
[18:27] <kat``> when friend bob sent me my external drive he copied most of my tunes and at times same exact file is in multiple folders soooo
[18:27] <Flaim> brendan, does mike need the .rgt, or does he generate those on the fly?
[18:29] <Flaim> mike, shit
