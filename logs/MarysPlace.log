[01:23:25] <pontiki> seems like a waste of a vise....

[09:35:49] <Ogredude> pontiki: well the vise wasn't doing anything else useful at the moment
[09:36:06] <Ogredude> and I was so damn stoned, I was constantly forgetting my piece count
[09:39:27] <Flaim> hehe
[09:51:42] <Ogredude> that's the only possible way to make hacksawing short lengths of rod at all entertaining
[09:51:53] <Ogredude> I'm getting quotes from local machine shops to have these damn things cut for me
[09:52:15] <Ogredude> I discovered that Home Depot charges roughly 10 times what I can get steel rod for elsewhere, so I've suddenly got a budget for machining
[10:00:39] <Flaim> yeah, home depot is like last-minute desperation shopping only.

[14:58:30] <Ogredude> gonna go back there this evening, I need a new hacksaw blade
[14:59:05] <Ogredude> but yeah, I just got back from getting 20 feet of rod for less than what Home Depot charges for 3 feet of it
[14:59:18] <Ogredude> got some quotes in from machine shops, surprisingly expensive
[14:59:36] <Ogredude> they're quoting $1.30 - $1.50 for a piece made of $0.02 worth of steel
[14:59:40] <Ogredude> so their labor costs are HUGE
[15:01:39] <Ogredude> I was figuring on $0.15 - $0.20 per part
[18:14:25] <Flaim> build your own tools. :)
[18:14:28] <pontiki> oof
[18:14:33] <pontiki> home
[18:14:38] <Flaim> oof!
