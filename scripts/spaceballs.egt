<Princess Vespa> I am Princess Vespa, daughter of Roland, King of the Druids.¶<Lone Starr> Oh great. That's all we needed. A Druish princess.
<Barf> I'm a mog. Half man, half dog. I'm my own best friend!

<Dark Helmet> What's the matter, Colonel Sandurz? CHICKEN???
<Dark Helmet> Out of order? FUCK! Even in the future, nothing works!

<President Skroob> Why didn't somebody tell me my ass was so big?
<Dark Helmet> So, Lone Starr, now you see that evil will always triumph because good is dumb.
<Yogurt> And may the Schwartz be with you!
<Dark Helmet> I bet she gives great helmet.
