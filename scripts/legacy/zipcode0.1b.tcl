# ZIPCODE.tcl v.1b for Eggdrop 1.4.3 and higher
#	Flaim	flaim@flaim.net
#
#
# TO USE:  o    Set the desired ZIPCODE field keywords to the
#               `ZIPCODE-fields' line below where indicated.
#          o    Load this script on a 1.1.6 or later Eggdrop bot.
#          o    Begin having users save the desired information.  If you
#               choose to add the default "IRL" field, they just use
#               the IRC command: /MSG <botnick> my ZIPCODE is <ZIPCODE>
#          o    See the new information now appear with the whois command.
#
# This script enhances the `whois' output utilizing the `whois-fields'
# option of eggdrop 1.1-grant and later versions.  It adds the functionality
# of whois.tcl used in pre-1.1-grant versions.
#
# The fields desired to be maintained in the userfile `xtra' information
# should be put in `ZIPCODE-fields'.  This is different than the Eggdrop
# configuration variable `whois-fields' in that this script will add the
# commands to change these fields.   It will also add these desired fields
# to the `whois-fields' itself, so do not define them there as well.  The
# fields added in `ZIPCODE-fields' will be converted to upper case for
# aesthetics in the `whois' command output.
#
# The commands that will be added to the running eggdrop are:
#  (<info> will be the respective userfile field added in `ZIPCODE-fields')
#
#   TYPE    COMMAND         USAGE
#   ======  ==============  ========================================
#   msg     my ZIPCODE is     To change your <info> via /MSG.
