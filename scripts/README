".egt" is simply an extention meaning "EGgdrop Text file"; it was one of the few extensions not in use that I could find. (And something like my 8th choice)

Mike was scripted on a Mandrake (2005 LE & Free) install using KWrite and vi, on a Dell PowerEdge 1550 (Dual 1.133 GHz PIII, 2GB RAM)

And last, but most hearfelt, to Spider Robinson for creating Callahan's and Mike Callahan!
