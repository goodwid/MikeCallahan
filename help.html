<p><a name="Registering" id="Registering"></a><span style=
"text-decoration: overline underline"><font size="4">Meeting Mike for the first 
time</font></span><br />

For many of the advanced features of Mike, you need to register with him.&nbsp; 
This is fairly easy to do, provided you follow these instructions exactly.&nbsp; 
Almost every error is of a <a href=
"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PEBKAC">PEBKAC</a> nature and can therefore be 
avoided by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RTFM">RTFM</a> (This document).</p>
<p>The first step is to type <font color="#808080"><code>/msg Callahan hello</code></font><br />
This will introduce you to him, but you're not done yet; there is at least one 
more command you <b>must</b> utilize, and not doing this ASAP could cause a 
world of issues, as by not having a password, you will be unable to make any 
changes later on. This makes for very unhappy users, as based on empirical 
evidence during the beta stage. We highly recommend a password that you can 
remember easily, as there is no way to recover it should you forget it.</p>

<p><font color="#808080"><code>/msg Callahan</code></font> <code><font color=
"#808080">PASS &lt;password&gt;</font></code></p>
That's all there is!<br />
<a href="http://3whack.org/mike/help.html#top">Back to top</a>
<p><a name="Recognition" id="Recognition"></a><span style=
"text-decoration: overline underline"><font size="4">Teaching Mike your many 
guises</font></span><br />
Mike can remember as many <a href=
"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hostmask">hostmasks</a> for you as he has disk 
space available. There are two ways to teach him new hostmasks to recognize you 
with:<br />
IDENT: <code><font color="#808080">/msg Callahan IDENT &lt;password&gt;</font></code><br />

This is the recommended way if you do not understand what &quot;hostmask&quot; means, and 
how to determine it and using wildcards to describe it. This<br />
will only add the current hostmask you are using.<br />
ADDHOST: <code><font color="#808080">/msg Callahan ADDHOST &lt;password&gt; &lt;hostmask&gt;</font></code><br />
This is the more advanced way, as you can add a hostmask that you are not 
currently using, but know you will use, such as from work, or a shell account. 
Be careful you don't set too liberal a hostmask; if you use this method, you are 
responsible for errors arising from it. If you are uncomfortable with this, use 
IDENT.&nbsp;&nbsp; The hostmask specified must not match the hostmask of another 
user.</p>

Our highly recommended solution is to register with CService for undernet. You 
will need to visit <a href="http://cservice.undernet.org/live">Undernet Channel 
Service Web Interface</a>, and sign up with a username. Avoid free email 
accounts such as Yahoo!, or hotmail as many have been disabled for use, due to 
high abuse levels. Once you've registered with CService, and confirmed, you will 
need to login when you sign on to IRC, using the following command:
<code><font color="#808080">/msg</font> <font color=
"#808080">X@channels.undernet.org</font> <font color="#808080">&lt;username&gt; 
&lt;password&gt;</font></code><br />
Once this is done, you can hide your true hostmask, with one of this format: 
&quot;&lt;username&gt;.users.undernet.org&quot;&nbsp; by typing <code><font color=
"#808080">/mode &lt;your nick&gt; +x</font></code> <i>(Mike's is 
MikeCallahan.users.undernet.org&nbsp; Please be sure this is the info for the 
bot you are messaging any passwords to, Mike *can*, and *has* been imitated 
before)</i> Please note that username does not always mean your nick. The reason 
this is recommended, is that no matter where you are IRCing from, you can have a 
consistent hostmask to use. This can be the only hostmask you ever have to tell 
Mike about, if you do the above steps before saying hello. Many IRC clients have 
means to do the login and mode commands automatically each time you sign on; 
check your documentation.<br />

<p><a name="Data" id="Data"></a><span style=
"text-decoration: overline underline"><font size="4">Teaching Mike your personal 
information</font></span><br />
Mike can keep several bits of information about you; currently there are only 
two, but more will be implemented as time goes on.</p>
<p>TAGLINE: <code><font color="#808080">/msg Callahan my tagline is &lt;tagline&gt; 
/msg Callahan What is|What's my tagline?</font></code><br />
To get this information from Mike, there are two commands to use:
<i><code><font color="#808080">Mike, who am I?</font></code></i> to retrieve 
your own and <code><font color="#808080"><i>Mike, who is &lt;nick&gt;</i></font></code><sup>[1]</sup> 

to retrieve other's</p>
<p>USUAL: <code><font color="#808080">/msg Callahan my usual is &lt;usual&gt; 
/msg Callahan What is|What's my usual</font></code><br />
This can be used to set your usual &quot;drink&quot; (it can be anything, not necessarily 
a beverage). This is used in many situations, such as when someone is at the 
line and you enter, as well as Mike randomly picking patron's usuals for various 
uses to use in channel.<br />
We do have some advice for syntax in setting this. Mike will usually do 
something of the nature &quot;Callahan serves Foo &lt;foo's usual&gt;&quot;, so we suggest using 
proper English articles, such as &quot;some&quot;, &quot;a/an&quot;, &quot;the&quot;.&nbsp; If you're Foo, and 
you set it by typing <code><font color="#808080">/msg Callahan my usual is a 
heap of lottery money, with a gold bullion chaser</font></code>

it will come out &quot;Callahan serves Foo a heap of lottery money, with a gold 
bullion chaser.&quot;&nbsp; Also note that Mike added the period; please do not add 
this yourself, as Mike uses this for other things, and will insert the proper 
punctuation himself, such as &quot;Callahan serves Foo a heap of lottery money, with 
a gold bullion chaser, courtesy of Bar&quot;.&nbsp; Note this looks a lot odder if 
it's &quot;Callahan serves Foo a heap of lottery money, with a gold bullion chaser., 
courtesy of Bar&quot;<sup>[2]</sup></p>
<p>There are several ways to use the usual functions:<br />
<font color="#808080"><i>Mike, usual</i></font> (Give a vague request, get a 
vague answer)<br />

<font color="#808080"><i>Mike, my usual</i></font> (Can also be followed by 
anything else such as &quot;please&quot; or &quot;stat&quot;, though he will ignore them)<br />
<font color="#808080"><i>Mike, give|get me &lt;nicks's&gt; usual</i></font><sup>[1]</sup><br />
<font color="#808080"><i>Mike, give|get &lt;nick&gt; my usual</i><br />

<i>Mike, give|get &lt;nick&gt; &lt;nick's&gt; usual</i><br />
<i>Mike, give|get &lt;nick&gt; his|their|her usual</i></font><br />
Please be sure to use proper possessives, such as &quot;foo's&quot; or &quot;Bars'&quot;<sup>[3]</sup><br />

<a name="Food" id="Food"></a><span style=
"text-decoration: overline underline"><font size="4">Fly, there's a waiter in my 
soup!</font></span><br />

Mike has an extensive kitchen hidden behind that bar, and it is at your command:<i><br/>
Mike, 
breakfast|brunch|lunch|dinner|appetizer</i> Mike will pick from the requested 
menu, and tell you what he recommends.<br />
<i>Mike, snack</i> Mike will pick from a newly installed vending machine, and 
tell you what he recommends, and its price in varying currencies<br />
<i>Mike, bless me|&lt;nick&gt;</i> Mike serves a God's Blessing.<br />
You can have Mike serve you his last recommendation by telling him <i>Mike, I'll 
have|take some|one</i><br />

Mike will remember his last recommendation until someone asks him again. Be 
daring sometime, and simply ask him for some, and see what turns up!<br />
<i>Mike, chocolate</i> Mike will pick from a chocolate collection, and give you 
his find. Note you don't have to specifically ask him for it like the above, 
after all, have you ever seen a chocolate lover refuse?<br />
<br />
If you wish to provide either more items for the above, or something new, please

Mike has all sorts of activities you can get him to do.</p>
<i>Mike, tape &lt;nick&gt;&nbsp;</i> Mike will tape a patron to a random location in the 
bar. He has many different kinds, and in several glaring color schemes.  133,981 
to be exact, if you combine colors, locations, and types of tape.&nbsp; If you 
do just colors &amp; types of tape, it's 8,943 combinations of colors &amp; tapes.<sup>[1]</sup><br />
<i>Mike, hose &lt;nick&gt;&nbsp;</i> Mike will hose said person, in various locations on 
their body. Usually.<br />

<i>Mike, button</i> Mike will grab a button from his never ending supply, and 
pin it on you.&nbsp; Currently 494 in the database.<br />
<i>Mike, fortune</i> Mike will grab a fortune cookie, eat the cookie, and leave 
you with the fortune.&nbsp; Currently 4,198 in the database.<br />
<i>Mike, unusual</i> Mike will grab something unusual from under the bar, and 
give it to you.&nbsp; Currently 39 in the database (Donations welcome!)<sup>[4]</sup><br />

<i>Mike, soapbox</i> Mike will get you a soapbox to stand on.&nbsp; There is no 
functionality for this like there is for a Toast, nor is there any planned 
functionality, as this is an informal device.<br />
<i>Mike, play</i> Mike will start XMMS up and play something randomly. Currently 
6,881 tracks in the database.<br />

<a name="Info" id="Info"></a><span style=
"text-decoration: overline underline"><font size="4">Inquiring minds want to 
&quot;Oh, no!&quot;</font></span><br />
Mike has some features which are more on an informational level, some 
functional, some not even remotely guaranteed.<br />

<br />
<i>Mike, when|how long *</i> Mike will attempt to calculate an answer for you. 
With expected deviation.<br />
<i>Mike, who *</i> Mike will attempt to say who fits your condition. He's a bit 
fickle at times, so don't expect consistency.<br />
<i>Mike, should|would|will|shall|could|can|may|is</i> Mike will attempt to 
squeeze an answer out of Yoda.<br />
<i>Mike, FAQ|rules</i> Mike will display the URL for this page. Tom will spew 
details in channel.<br />

<i>Mike, help</i> Mike will give the URL for this page. NOTE: This is not the 
same as messaging Mike for help. There will be an online help function, done by 
message, that will mostly echo what is here.&nbsp; It was planned to be 
implemented for v1.0, but will be instead included in v1.1<br />
<i>Mike, seen &lt;nick&gt; | /msg Callahan seen &lt;nick&gt;</i> Mike will tell you via NOTICE when he last saw that person.<br />
